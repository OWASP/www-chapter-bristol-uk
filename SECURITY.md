## Security Policy

This project is built on markdown and it is not impossible that a malicious actor
could somehow embed malware in the markdown or subvert the a process.
If you find anything suspicious in either the markdown or pipeline scripts
then let us know ASAP and we will fix it as a priority.

Ideally open a [security advisory][advisory] and this will be provided
only to the project's admins in strict confidence.

Alternatively send an encrypted email to [Jon Gadsden][mail] to start the secure disclosure process.
