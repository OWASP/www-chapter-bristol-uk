Abstract:
Distributed Security Champions: working for developers

Most of us are familiar with Security Champions programs and how they can help
bridge the gap between the developers and security teams.
Ideally when a Security Champions program is is in place then the development team can
ensure the Secure Development LifeCycle is effective, but what about in practice?

This talk seeks to identify problems with existing Security Champions programs
and suggests a new paradigm: Distributed Security Champions.
