Abstract:
OWASP Developer Guide rebooted
If you have ever asked yourself the question:
“I am a developer and I need a reference source to navigate the numerous projects
and describe the security activities I really should be doing”
then this talk is for you, along with anybody else who is interested in product security.

The Developer Guide was literally the first document produced by OWASP way back in 2002;
it predates even the OWASP Top 10.
With the last version of the Developer Guide published in 2005 it was definitely time for a reboot,
and OWASP decided that a Developer Guide is needed now more than ever.
This short talk will introduce the various sections of the Developer Guide
and explain how they can help a development team in their day to day activities
