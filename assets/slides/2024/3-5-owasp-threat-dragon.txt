Abstract:
OWASP Threat Dragon
Threat Modeling is becoming more and more prominent in the security community;
it is recognised as an important part of compliance, pipelines and software development.
This talk provides the reasons for doing threat modeling, what to look for in threat modeling,
and how to threat model using the OWASP Threat Dragon tool.
It will introduce the various features of Threat Dragon
and show how to use them to create a complete threat model.
The talk will include illustrations of Threat Dragon as it goes along, and if time permits then
a demonstration can be given of creating a complete threat model using Threat Dragon.
