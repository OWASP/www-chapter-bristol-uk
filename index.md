## Welcome to OWASP Bristol Chapter

The OWASP Bristol Chapter is run by [Katy Anton][katy], [Craig Francis][craig] and [Jon Gadsden][jon].

We are  a bunch of friendly people interested in Application Security,
and as Software is all over these days this means we are interested in every flavour of security.

* Chapter meetings promotion is primarily done on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/owaspbristol/)
* We post videos of our meetings on our [YouTube Bristol channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OWASPBristol/featured)
* Discussions and questions are welcome on our chapter [OWASP slack channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/CTRQ33DMK)
