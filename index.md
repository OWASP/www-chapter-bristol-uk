## Welcome to OWASP Bristol Chapter

The Bristol Chapter located in England and we are a bunch of friendly people interested in application security.
We meet up four or five times a year to discuss a whole range of security topics, always in-person but with some of our meetings being hybrid.

The OWASP Bristol Chapter is run by [Craig Francis][craig] and [Jon Gadsden][jon].
We are pleased to have the support of [WiTCH][witch] (Women in Tech & Cyber Hub)
in promoting a more diverse software security community in the South West of England.
