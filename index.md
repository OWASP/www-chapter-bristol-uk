## Welcome to OWASP Bristol Chapter

The OWASP Bristol Chapter is run by [Craig Francis][craig] and [Jon Gadsden][jon].
We are  a bunch of friendly people interested in application security
and we meet up four or five times a year to discuss a whole range of security topics.

The Bristol Chapter is pleased to have the support of [WiTCH][witch] (Women in Tech & Cyber Hub)
in promoting a more diverse software security community in the South West of England.

### Social media

* Our meetings are scheduled on [Meetup][meetup]
* We post videos of some of the  meetings on our [YouTube Bristol][youtube] channel
* Discussions and questions are welcome in our chapter [OWASP slack][slack] channel and [LinkedIn page][linkedin]

## Chapter Meetings

Typically our meetings are held in the evening and last for a couple of hours.
View the schedule on the [events tab](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-bristol-uk/#div-events)
for our next meeting and also for past meetings.

All types of talks and presentations are encouraged :

* Short / lightning talks, approximately 10 minutes on a specific subject
* Longer talks between 30 and 45 minutes
* Wider ranging presentation or tutorials up to an hour long
