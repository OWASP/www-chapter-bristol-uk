# Welcome to OWASP Bristol Chapter 

The OWASP Bristol Chapter  is  run by [Katy Anton](mailto:katy.anton@owasp.org) and [Craig Francis](mailto:craig.francis@owasp.org) .

We are  a bunch of friendly people interested in Application Security, and as Software is all over these days, means we
are interested in every flavour of security. 

## Social media
* Our meetings are scheduled on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Bristol/) 
* Chapter meetings promotion is primarily done on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OWASPBristol)
